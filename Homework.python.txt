# First, Last and Age Variables
first = "Ronick"
last = "Thomas"
age = "38"
print first + last + age

#The Pythagorean Theorem
#(SideC * SideC) = (Side A * sideA) + (SideB * SideB)
sideA = 12.55
sideB = 17.85
sideC = (sideA * sideA) + (sideB * sideB)
print (sideC * sideC)

#Variable Operations
operand1 = 94
operand2 = 64.5
print operand1 + operand2
print operand1 - operand2
print operand1 * operand2
print operand1 / operand2
print operand1 % operand2

# I think the this method is good for a beginner but probably will be easier with time. If the variables changed I shouldn't have to change any code.
